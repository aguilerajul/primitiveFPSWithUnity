# primitiveFPSWithUnity

This a basic Shooter using Unity 3D

## Things implemented here:
1. Game Scene.
2. Intro Scene
3. Game Scene
4. Credits Scene
5. Game Over Scene

**The bullets are not created with raycast, they are objets and that will make the game slow**, the reason why all the bullets are objets is because was a my first shooter game and for the moment when was created i didn't know how to use the raycast.

##Things that will be implemented in the future:

1. Fire with Raycast.
2. Change the Stage 1 for other more easy to play with easy mechanics.
3. Changes in the UI (Objects position)
4. Animations.
